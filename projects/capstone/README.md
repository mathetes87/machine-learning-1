## Project: Capstone Proposal and Capstone Project

### About
This project consists of training a machine learning model to predict the future movement of a Forex market currency pair, specificaly the EUR/USD currency pair.

### Dependencies
The dependencies needed to run the code are the following:

* h5py (2.7.1)
* ipython (5.5.0)
* Keras (2.1.2)
* matplotlib (2.1.1)
* numpy (1.13.3)
* pandas (0.21.1)
* scikit-learn (0.19.1)
* tensorflow (1.4.1)
* tqdm (4.19.5)

### Steps to reproduce results
1. Preprocess data.ipynb
2. Train network.py 
3. Model basic monetization.ipynb

### Results
The results are not good... sadly. The LSTM network and its various different architecture attempts were not able to succesfuly derive a profitable tradin strategy. Either way, this was expected and the project was an extremely rich source to learn about an end to end solution to a specific problem that in theory could be solved using machine learning techniques.
